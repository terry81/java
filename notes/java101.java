// All objects in Java have a toString() method, inherited from the Object class.

// The method equals() tests strings for equality. In contrast, == tests for objects identity, i.e. whether the two tested arguments are the same.

//Example with the string method contains()
String log = "There is an emergency";
if(log.contains("emergency")) pageSomeone();
